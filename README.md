# Data Visualization Assignment

This week's assignment is focused on Data Visualization, and as such, it is the most open ended.

Your assignment is, simply put, to find a dataset you like, and make a compelling data visualization.

You have different options:

* You can create a folium map that tells a story (and save it to html)
* You can create a dashboard (using jupyter dashboards and ipywidget for example)
* You can create a jupyter notebook where you tell a story using data visualization
* You can check [dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) to build a very beautiful dashboard relatively easily.
* You can check the data visualization bonus class to find alternative plotting libraries. Each one has its own set of features (faster/slower, interactive/static, basic/complex)

Be creative! Find a dataset that is inspiring to you and find a way to inspire other people by using data visualization techniques!
